# 🧠 CBL Project: Integrating AI to Enhance Dialysis Care

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of a Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) initiative aiming to transform dialysis treatment through advanced AI techniques. The platform leverages **medical** and **machine-generated data** to improve **real-time monitoring**, reduce clinical risks, and assist **decision-making** in dialysis care.

The work is currently ongoing and structured into key domains to tackle both clinical and operational challenges using machine learning, deep learning, and signal processing.

## 🧩 Project Components

### 1️⃣ Patient Monitoring

- **📉 Real-time Blood Pressure Monitoring**  
  Use of **time-series models** on streaming data to identify abnormal blood pressure trends in hemodialysis patients for early intervention.

- **🎧 Vascular Access Abnormality Detection from Sound**  
  Apply **signal processing + AI detection models** to analyze sounds generated during dialysis and flag access issues (e.g., stenosis) in real-time.

- **😖 Pain Detection via Facial Expressions**  
  Real-time detection of patient pain using **computer vision and facial emotion recognition**, helping medical staff act quickly.
